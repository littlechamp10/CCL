Connected Component Labeling (CCL) is one of the most important step in pattern
recognition and image processing. It assigns labels to the pixels such that
adjacent pixels sharing the same features are assigned the same label.
Typically, CCL requires several passes over the data. We focus on two-pass technique where 
each pixel is given a provisional label in the first pass whereas an actual
label is assigned in the second pass.

We present a scalable parallel two-pass CCL algorithm, called \paremsp,\ 
which employs a scan strategy and the best union-find
technique called \remsp,\ which uses \rems\ algorithm for storing label
equivalence information of pixels in a 2-D image. In the first pass, we divide the image among threads and each
thread runs the scan phase along with \remsp\
simultaneously. In the second phase, we assign the final labels to the pixels. As \remsp\ is easily parallelizable, we use the parallel
version of \remsp\ for merging the pixels on the boundary. Our experiments
show the scalability of \paremsp\ achieving speedups up to $20.1$ using $24$
cores on shared memory architecture using {\em OpenMP} for an image of size
$465.20$ MB. We find that our proposed parallel algorithm achieves
linear scaling for a  large resolution fixed problem size as the number of
processing elements are increased. Additionally, the parallel algorithm does
not make use of any hardware specific routines, and thus is highly portable.
