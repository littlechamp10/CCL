Connected Component Labeling(CCL) is one of the most important step in pattern recognition and image processing. Connected
component labeling assigns labels to a pixel such that adjacent pixels sharing the same features are assigned the same label.
Typically, CCL requires several passes over the data. For example, in a two-pass technique, the first pass, each pixel is given
a provisional label and label equivalence information is stored. In the second pass,an actual label is given to each pixel. 
Suzuki et al have proposed two algorithms for CCL with two-pass technique called Link by Rank and Path Compression(LRPC), and ARun.
The $LRPC$ algorithm uses a decision tree to assign provisional labels and an array-based union-find datastructure to store label equivalence information.
The $ARun$ algorithm employs a special scan order over the data and three linear arrays instead of the conventional union-find datastructure. 
To the best of our knowledge, there has not been any effort yet on parallelizing two-pass CCL for shared memory architecture.

We present a scalable parallel two-pass CCL algorithm called $PARemSP$, which employs scan strategy of $ARun$ algorithm and the best union-find technique called 
$RemSP$ for storing label equivalence information of pixels in a $2$-D image. In the first pass, we divide the image among threads and each thread runs the scan 
strategy of $ARun$ algorithm along with $RemSP$ simultaneously. As $RemSP$ is easily parallelizable, we use the parallel version of $RemSP$ for merging the pixels 
on the boundary. Our experiments show the scalability of $PARemSP$ achieving speedups up to $19.5$ using $24$ cores on shared memory architecture for an image of 
size $11,411 \times 10,192$. Additionally, the parallel algorithm does not make use of any hardware specific routines, and thus is highly portable.
