Connected Component Labeling(CCL) is one of the most important step in pattern recognition and image processing. Connected 
component labeling assigns labels to a pixel such that adjacent pixels sharing the same features are assigned the same label.
Past literature on CCL have proposed strategies of repeated passes and two pass over the data.Two pass algorithms traverse the 
image twice. In the first traversal, provisional label is given to each pixel and label equivalence imformation is stored. In the 
second traversal, actual label is given to each pixel. The $LRPC$ algorithm by Wu, Otoo and Suzuki provides two optimization strategies:
$1)$ use of decision tree $2)$ use of array-based union-find technique. The $ARun$ algorithm by He,Chao and Suzuki scans the image line two by 
two and uses another technique instead of the conventional union-find for storing label equivalence information.

We present an optimization strategy to improve two-pass connected-component labeling algorithms. In this paper, we propose two algorithms
using the algorithms $LRPC$ and $ARun$ and our optimization strategy. The optimization strategy uses the best optimized union-find technique 
called $RemSP$ for storing label equivalence information of pixels in a $2$-D image. We also provide the parallel version of the modified 
algorithm using OpenMP. Our experiment show that our proposed algorithm achieved a speedup of 19.5 on $24$ cores on a binary image of 
$11411\times10192$ pixels. Also, the parallel algorithm does not make use of any hardware specific routines, and thus is highly portable.
