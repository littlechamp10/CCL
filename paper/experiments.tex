\section{Experiments}

For the experiments we used Hopper. Hopper is NERSC's first peta-flop system, a Cray XE6, with a peak performance of 1.28 Petaflops/sec, 
153,216 compute cores for running scientific applications, 217 Terabytes of memory, and 2 Petabytes of online disk storage. All algorithms
were implemented in C using OpenMP and compiled with gcc.

Our test dataset consists of 4 types of image dataset: Texture, Arial, Miscellaneous and NLCD. First three datasets are taken from the image database
of the University of Southern California. The fourth dataset is taken from US National Cover Database 2006. All of the images are converted to binary
images by means of MATLAB.
