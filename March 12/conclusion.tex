\section{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}
In this paper, we presented two sequential CCL algorithms \nremsp\ and \aremsp\
which are based on union-find technique of \rems\ algorithm and scan strategies 
of \arun\ and \lrpc\ algorithms. \nremsp\ algorithm uses the scan strategy of
\lrpc\ algorithm whereas \aremsp\ uses the scan strategy of \arun\ algorithm.
Based on the experiments, we found out that \aremsp\ outperforms all the
other sequential algorithms. We also implement a portable parallel
implementation of \aremsp\ for shared memory computers with standard OpenMP
directives.
Our proposed algorithm, \paremsp,\ divides the image into equal proportions and
executes the scan. 
To merge the provisional labels on the image boundary, we use the parallel version of \rems\ algorithm. 
Our experimental results conducted on a shared memory computer show scalable performance, achieving speedups up
to a factor of $20.1$ when using $24$ cores on data set of size $465.20$ MB. Thus, our parallel algorithm achieves linear scaling for large
fixed problem size while the number of processing elements are increased.
