\section{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}
In this paper, we presented two sequential CCL algorithms \remsp\ and \aremsp\
which are based on union-find technique of \rems\ algorithm and scan strategies 
of \arun\ and \lrpc\ algorithms. \remsp\ algorithm uses the scan strategy of
\lrpc\ algorithm whereas \arun\ uses the scan strategy of \arun\ algorithm.
Based on the experiments, we found out that \aremsp\ outperforms over all the
other sequential algorithms. Then we present the parallel version of \aremsp
which gives a maximum speedup of $20.1$ on $24$ threads. Our experimental
results show that the parallel algorithm is scalable. As the algorithm just uses
the standard {\em OpenMP} directives thus is easily portable.
